# My leadership readme/operating manual
My leadership and manager operating manual. A guide to what you can expect from me as a manager, and what I expect in return.


## My Leadership Philosophy 

In general, I think it's my job to clear your path to let you do the best work you can. You've been hired because we think you have the potential to do great work and where possible, I don't want to tell you *how* to do that. That being said, I also try to tailor my style to what I think would suit you best, so you get a personalised experience. I'll also do my best to protect you from things that will stop you from doing your job.  

I massively value honesty - so if I have done something to annoy you, tell me and I will do my best to not do it again. I do genuinely try to action feedback so welcome it. I expect the same from you. 

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")
 

### What makes you grumpy?

I get frustrated when there is a lot of politics. I want to do my best work and red tape often gets in the way of the potential things that could be done.

### How will I know when you're grumpy?

You'll know. I can be short tempered under pressure.


### How can I help you when you're grumpy?

Ask if I'm ok. Then either spend 5 minites listening to me moan or leave me alone - You'll know which!


### How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

Face-to-face is my preferred communication method. My ideal flow would be a slack message to arrange a face-to-face chat (if its urgent I'll drop what I'm doing), and then an email to summarise if decisions are made.


### How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

As-it-happens and ideally face to face where possible. 


### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

It depends, if I've done something to help you personally, a quiet word is fine. If I've done exceptional work, then publicly.


### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

If I can understand where you are experiencing problems, the root cause, and what the impact is on you, I can move quickly to identify actions and support. Alternatively, if you don't want direct support but a chance to vent - just let me know. Knowing what level of support you need is useful.


### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

* Learn as much as possible about the "non-tech" side of the business
* Step away from the day to day actions required in the team and define strategy
* Focus on improving the people I line manage

### What do you need from your manager?

Autonomy and trust are key for me. I will only contact you if I need help - so you should know this is important. 
Otherwise, I should be allowed to find my own path to solutions.

## My expectations of people who report to me

As conveniently as possible, let me know where you need my direct support. The sooner I know about something, the earlier I can give you what you need. 

If I come to you with a requirement, or a task and you agree to support it, I expect you to honour that commitment. I won't ask you to help me with tasks that aren't important and trivial without saying so, so if you don't realistically think you can do something tell me, and I'll work around it.

Be honest with me, and let me know what challenges you have. It's easier to solve problems when I know what they are, and Iâ€™ll never consider seeking support as a sign of complaining or a weakness.


## What you can expect of me as your manager

Transparency and honesty on how I think you're doing. I'll praise regularly when I think you're doing great, and speak openly and clearly to you about the things I need to see change. Whenever I give feedback I'll make sure to include practical examples that you can work on. I'll never set you a goal that I don't feel you have the means and support to achieve.

I'll share my goals with you, so you always know what my priorities are, and what I'm working on. When I do this, I'll share where I need your input. When setting objectives for you, it will always be with your own career aspirations in mind.

I promise to encourage a healthy work/life balance and advocate for your well-being at all times. I do not expect you to work weekends or evenings regularly. There may be times where this is required but the rest of the time I won't be clock watching. I expect you to manage your own time - I won't be checking what time you come in or go home - these aren't important as long as the work gets done and no one outside the team is questioning your time keeping/performance. I personally work strange hours - sometimes you might see me go home at 3, or online at 11pm - It's fine with me if you do the same.
