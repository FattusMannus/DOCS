# My leadership readme/operating manual
My leadership and manager operating manual. A guide to what you can expect from me as a manager, and what I expect in return.


## My Leadership Philosophy 

I believe it is my role to help guide you by clarifying the unknowns and giving you a clear direction to an end goal. If I'm doing my job correctly you should always know what your objectives are, and be empowered to achieve them. I value honesty and transparency when discussing issues, and promise the same in return. If I make a promise to you, I intend to keep it as I value being accountable for what I say I am going to deliver.

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")
 

### What makes you grumpy?

It's cheesy, but I really value team work and people collaborating. I get grumpy if others don't pull together and put personal agenda before the team. I'd rather we honestly spoke about our agendas and compromised where possible. 

I also get [hangry](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/hangry-meaning) from time-to-time, so 11.30am you might notice I'm grumpy. ðŸ˜¡


### How will I know when you're grumpy?

I'll tell you ðŸ˜‰. I am guilty of being impatient when stressed, which can be interpreted as grumpy.


### How can I help you when you're grumpy?

A good joke does the trick. Ideally, a really silly, cheesy one.


### How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

Face-to-face is my preferred communication method. My ideal flow would be a slack message to arrange a face-to-face chat (if its urgent I'll drop what I'm doing), and then an email to summarize. I use email as my 'to do' list, so a written confirmation of it helps me keep track of the conversation and keeps it on my radar.


### How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

As-it-happens. I believe that there should be no surprises when it comes to formal 1:1s or reviews, and that challenges are easier to address through honest, regular feedback. 


### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

Public ðŸŽ‰


### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

If I can understand where you are experiencing problems, the root cause, and what the impact is on you, I can move quickly to identify actions and support. Alternatively, if you don't want direct support but a chance to vent - just let me know. Knowing what level of support you need is useful.


### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

* Create metrics for my teams to measure their inner-sourcing adoption
* Create development plans for the engineers within my teams
* Produce code dependency reports on the skills required to managed the tech estate for my teams


### What do you need from your manager?

The autonomy and trust to delivery on my objectives. I also like to know my manager will challenge me to do more when I'm performing well, and to let me know when I've messed up. I also like to know my manager has my back if I go to them with a problem.

## My expectations of folks who report to me

If you're a manager yourself, you're the one I rely on to know what issues or challenges your direct reports face. So please invest in time to understand these, and surface any challenges they might have. 

As conveniently as possible, let me know where you need my direct support. The sooner I know about something, the earlier I can give you what you need. 

If I come to you with a requirement, or a task and you agree to support it, I expect you to honour that commitment. I won't ask you to help me with tasks that aren't important and trivial without saying so, so if you don't realistically think you can do something tell me, and I'll work around it.

Be honest with me, and let me know what challenges you have. It's easier to solve problems when I know what they are, and Iâ€™ll never consider seeking support as a sign of complaining or a weakness. 


## What you can expect of me as your manager

Transparency and honesty on how I think you're doing. I'll praise regularly when I think you're doing great, and speak openly and clearly to you about the things I need to see change. Whenever I give feedback I'll make sure to include practical examples that you can work on. I'll never set you a goal that I don't feel you have the means and support to achieve.

I'll share my goals with you, so you always know what my priorities are, and what I'm working on. When I do this, I'll share where I need your input. When setting objectives for you, it will always be with your own career aspirations in mind.

I promise to encourage a healthy work/life balance, and advocate for your well-being at all times.
